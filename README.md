# JupyterProjects
These are all the projects done in Jypyter.

## Descriptions
### EvenBettingSimulator
Even Betting, or Fixed Amount Betting, is a betting method which bet a fixed amount of money each time, no matter win or loss.
This simulator shows the income by using this method.

### D'AlembertBettingSimulator
A great amount of people suggest the D'Alembert Betting Method as the best method to bet. I'm here to test it.
The D'Alembert Betting Method suggest you to decide a base unit(money), start with one, and increase one after a loss and decrease one after a win.
Check https://www.gamblingsites.com/systems-strategies/dalembert/ for more details.

### ProportionalBettingSimulator
My dad has been using Proportional Betting in the stock market ever since. I decide to test and report it to him about how likely this method would help him earn money.
Proportional Betting is basically decide a fixed ratio about how much of your money you want to keep in the stock market, and keep adjusting the amount of money in the stock market to remain the ratio.
For example, if the ratio is set to be 1:1, that means you always keep half of your capital in the stock market, invest more when your stock value decreases and sell some stocks when the value increases.

### SimpleQuestionFourWays
One day, my dad threw a simple coding question to me, and he kept asking for adjustments regarding my solution.
So I thought it would be fun to record our communications and codes.

### Tetris
This is Tetris the game! Familiarizing myself with ipywidgets and ipycanvas to create a playable tetris game on Jupyter!
It game automatically starts when you run the code. 
Use the arrows on your keyboard to control the movements. 
Press "down" for drop faster, "space" for immediately to the bottom.
Press "up" for clockwisely rotate the block, and "a" for counter-clockwisely rotate the block.

### WaveReflectionSimulator
Studying boundary behaviour which can be simulated by a wave travelling through a string. 
The string can be fixed-end or free-end(in production).
Want to build a visualized simulator to mimic the situation and found interactive Jupyter very interesting.
